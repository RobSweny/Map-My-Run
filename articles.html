										<strong>The mental health benefits of running</strong>
											</br>You hit the pavement to improve your cardiovascular health, build muscle and, on occasion, to make up for that extra slice of chocolate cake. But did you know that while you're taking care of your body, you're also taking care of your mind?
										</br></br>
										Runners have touted the great feeling of a runner's high for years. As you begin to run, your heart starts pumping harder and pushing blood through your body at a faster rate. Your respiratory system starts working harder and you mentally prepare yourself for vigorous exercise. As you continue to push yourself to go harder and faster, your body starts releasing endorphins. These hormones act as a stimulant in the body, resulting in what many call a "natural high."
										</br></br>
										While experiencing a runner's high is one of the best ways to feel happy and relaxed, running and other forms of vigorous exercise actually provide a number of mental health benefits:
										</br></br>
										Stress management. Running can control stress and boost the body's ability to deal with existing mental tension. Exercise also increases concentrations of norepinephrine, a chemical that helps moderate the brain's response to stress.
										The sunshine vitamin. Taking your run outside on a sunny day helps your body produce vitamin D, a nutrient that can lessen your likelihood of experiencing depressive symptoms.
										Prevention of cognitive decline. While running doesn't "cure" Alzheimer's, it may help boost the brain's ability to minimize and slow cognitive decline that begins after age 45. Working out, especially between age 25 and 45, boosts the chemicals in the brain that support and prevents degeneration of the hippocampus, an important part of the brain for memory and learning.
										A calmer state of mind. The chemicals released during and after running can help people experiencing anxiety feel calmer. Whether you're hopping on a treadmill, track, trail or sidewalk, getting your body moving is a healthy way of coping with tough times.
										Brainpower boost. Cardiovascular exercise can create new brain cells and improve overall brain performance. A tough run increases levels of a brain-derived protein in the body, believed to help with decision-making, higher thinking and learning.
										A faster track to dreamland. For some, a moderate run can be the equivalent of a sleeping pill, even for people with insomnia. Moving around five to six hours before bedtime raises the body's core temperature. When the body temp drops back to normal a few hours later, it signals the body that it's time to sleep.
										Increased productivity. Feeling unmotivated? The solution might be just a short run away. Research shows that workers who take time for exercise on a regular basis are more productive and have more energy than peers who are less active.
										</br></br>
										While busy schedules can make it tough to squeeze in a gym session in the middle of the day, some experts believe that midday is the ideal time for a workout due to the body's circadian rhythms.
										Greater creativity. A heart-pumping run can boost creativity for up to two hours afterwards. Rather than staring at the blank page waiting for an exceptional idea to fall from the sky, get those legs moving and refresh your body and brain at the same time.
										</br></br>
										So the next time youâ€™re struggling to get out of bed for your morning run or thinking about skipping the gym, remember all the benefits you'll enjoy - head to toe.

										But it's not just about the occasional one-off feel good factor. Being active has a whole range of benefits when it comes to mental wellbeing.
										</br></br>
										It improves self-perception and self-esteem, mood and sleep quality, and it reduces stress, anxiety and fatigue. Physically active people have up to a 30% reduced risk of becoming depressed, and staying active helps those who are depressed recover.
										</br></br>
										In older people, staying active can improve cognitive function, memory, attention and processing speed, and reduce the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.
										"Walking has always been there for me, my confidence has grown immensely. I'm a totally different person now than I was ten years ago and I owe so much of that to walking."
										Kath, walker with bipolar disorder
										</br></br>
										The physical improvements you gain by walking can help to improve your mental health too. If you feel fitter and feel in control of your weight, your body image and confidence can increase - so it's not just the physical benefits that you'll notice when you start walking.
										</br></br>
										Walk regularly. Invest in your long-term health now and youâ€™ll see the difference that walking can make to your mind, your body and your social life. Walking in a group is a great way to get started and stay motivated, so find your local Walking for Health scheme and join us today.  </div>

										Times are pretty tough lately, to say the least. Mental health issues have soared because of the impact of COVID-19, and it comes as little surprise. Minimal contact with other people, hour after hour of being inside, itâ€™s no wonder that people are feeling the toll on their mental health as they do their best to protect their physical health.
										</br></br>
										But thereâ€™s a light at the end of the tunnel. Time in the outdoors is a surefire way to boost your mood, clear your mind, and dust yourself of any quarantine cobwebs.
										</br></br>
										Here are some of the many ways that hiking can help you shake the blues.
										</br></br>
										A breath of fresh air
										Believe it or not, the simplest bonus of hiking is getting to breathe a bit of fresh air. Being indoors too long is bad as interiors and built-up areas have reduced airflow and pockets of pollution. This is why spending time outside in more rural areas is so beneficial to the body. You see, fresh air actually helps to send more oxygen to the brain. Likewise, more oxygen in your system keeps you running at full capacity!
										</br></br>
										Clarity of mind
										Sometimes the noise of busy, modern living can be too much. Most of us have probably spent an ungodly amount of time in our homes as of late, so thereâ€™s never been a better time to get out to new surroundings.
										</br></br>
										By surrounding yourself in nature, you can open yourself up to more peaceful and relaxed feelings. Hiking is a great way to do this as the increased movement and exercise will leave a positive impact on your mood after a day out. Whatâ€™s more, hiking is a fantastic way of experiencing progression and reward. What better treat is there than a beautiful mountain view after a long trail?
										</br></br>
										Strengthening relationships
										Got a partner? Perhaps you live with a couple of members of your family? Well, hiking is a great way to spend quality time, strengthen your current relationships, and even forge brand new ones.
										</br></br>
										Hiking can be as easy and as difficult as you like. If youâ€™ve got some older or very younger loved ones, you can take a nice, relaxed stroll up a beginner trail. If you and your partner fancy something a bit more challenging, you can test your skills on something a bit more advanced or even make your own route. And at the end of the day, experiencing things together is a great way to bond and build future memories, so get stuck in!
										</br></br>
										Doing the same â€“ somewhere different
										Hiking doesnâ€™t always have to be something brand new. If you already exercise, jog, or even walk regularly, then hiking doesnâ€™t need to be an intimidating experience.
										</br></br>
										Sometimes, itâ€™s even good to bring other hobbies and passions with you along the hike. Perhaps youâ€™re somewhat of an amateur photographer, then bring a small camera and take some snaps along your journey. Likewise, if you enjoy journaling, then sitting down during a break can be a great opportunity to log your feelings and even take inspiration from the things around you.</div>
