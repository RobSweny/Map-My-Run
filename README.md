# Map-My-Run
College assignment to create a Business website.
This was a part of a three person project, we decided to make a website about running due to the
increased popularity of running due to the covid pandemic. The concept behind the website was to build
a sense of community with running. By downloading the website accompanying android app, users can go for a run
and upload their gps co-ords to our website. With users doing this around the world, users can attempt to map
the streets of the world

I was personally assigned to creating the homepage, android app, setting up firebase and writing gps co-ords to google map.
Hosting and google seo.

Technologies: javascript, html, css, firebase, android (java)
